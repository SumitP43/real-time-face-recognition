# real-time-face-recognition - Student Project (LBPH + OpenCV)

This starter kit contains everything your students need to build a simple, offline face recognition system using OpenCV's LBPH algorithm. It works on most laptops with a webcam and **does not require a GPU**.

## Project Structure
```
face_recognition_project/
├─ dataset/                 # generated by you (captured faces)
│  └─ <person_name>/        # one folder per person (e.g., "mohit", "priya")
├─ models/
│  ├─ model.yml             # trained LBPH model (generated)
│  └─ labels.json           # id-to-name mapping (generated)
├─ cascades/

│  ├─ train_model.py        # train LBPH model from dataset

## Quick Start

1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Capture face images for each person**  
   ```bash
   python src/capture_faces.py --name mohit --num 120
   python src/capture_faces.py --name priya --num 120
   ```
   - Look straight, then slightly left/right, up/down.
   - Ensure good lighting. Remove masks/caps for best results.

4. **Train the model**  
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Run recognition**  
   ```bash
   python src/recognize.py
   ```

## Tips
- Capture at least **60–150 images per person** for better accuracy.
- Keep the camera at eye level; avoid backlight.
- If recognition is poor, capture more diverse images and retrain.
- You can add more people anytime: capture again and retrain.

## Known Issues
- On Apple Silicon/macOS, you may need `pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.7.0.72` if camera issues occur.
- If `cv2.face` is missing, make sure you installed **opencv-contrib-python**, not just `opencv-python`.
